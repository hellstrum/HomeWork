            <h3>What is the difference between Coffee and Espresso?</h3>
            <h4>By Chase K.</h4>
            <p>The main difference between espresso and drip coffee is the preparation method used. In general, espresso is prepared using a much finer grind than what would be used to prepare drip coffee. These grinds are then tamped with 30-40 pounds of pressure into a portafilter basket so they are very compact. This prevents the water from blowing a hole into the grinds and making a poorly pulled shot. The time it takes for the hot water (nearly 200 degrees!) to run through the grinds should take around 15-20 seconds every time a single or double shot is pulled. Any longer or shorter amount of time will affect the way the shot looks and tastes. </p>

            <h3>What is a French Press and how does it work?</h3>
            <h4>By Brennan M.</h4>
            <p>A French Press is a glass container with a wire mesh attached to a plunger. Some French Presses will also have an optional nylon fin filter that will help to catch dust produced while grinding. To make coffee, you first allow water to come very close to a boil but just short of this point. You are looking for around 195 to 205 degrees. For more information on temperature see the section on water temperature. The press should be pre-warmed before preparing coffee in it. This will help keep the glass from absorbing as much heat when the hot water is put into the press thus making for a warmer coffee extraction. The press should contain approximately the same amount of very coarsely ground coffee as you would use for drip coffee. Let it brew for 2-3 minutes or until it is easy to press the plunger down. </p>

            <h3>How much caffeine is in decaf coffee beans?</h3>
            <h4>By Kyle P.</h4>
            <p>In the United States, federal regulations require that in order to label coffee beans as "decaffeinated" that coffee must have had its caffeine level reduced by no less than 97.5 percent. So how much caffeine is in decaf coffee? Anywhere from 0.1% to 2.5% depending on the decaffeinating method.</p>

            <h3>How did the concept of Fair Trade originate?</h3>
            <h4>By Peyman H.</h4>
            <p>The Fair Trade movement began in the late 1950s as alternative trade organizations (ATOs) emerged in Europe and the US to promote grassroots development through direct, equitable trade. These ATOs bought directly from Third World producers, eliminating the middlemen, and paid the producers a fair price while providing assistance in developing trading experience and market contacts. Such experiences helped producers raise their incomes while reducing their dependency on commercial middlemen. These first ATOs were primarily "Third World shops" which dealt mainly in handicrafts. Today, there are 3,000 of these shops in Europe organized in the Network of European World Shops, and about 100 in the US, organized in the Fair Trade Federation.</p>

            <h3>How should you store coffee</h3>
            <h4>By Braden Z.</h4>
            <p>Coffee beans must be isolated from air and moisture. Probably the best storage containers are made from glass or glazed ceramic, which have the added benefit of being easily cleaned. If glass is used, the container should be kept in a dark location (if only because light is, theoretically, usually an accelerant to chemical processes); in either case, the containers must be able to maintain an air- and moisture-proof seal. Alternately, mylar/plastic bags with one-way valves can also do a fine job so long as care is taken to ensuring an airtight seal. Regardless of the container, as stated above, do not purchase more whole-bean coffee than can be consumed in approximately a week to two weeks post-roast. Beans primarily stale as a result of the loss of aromatic and volatile compounds, which occurs continually with the outgassing of carbon dioxide (see "Degassing, resting, and storage" in the section on home coffee roasting). The effects of freezing are disputed. Some feel that the freezing will damage the subtle tastes in the coffee; less disputed is that moisture will condense on the cold beans each time the container is opened. At the least, avoid repeatedly opening the freezer-stored coffee: divide up your coffee supply into multiple containers (with as little airspace as possible) and keep one container out for use, not replacing it in the freezer after it is opened. If you do not have a local roaster, you may do well by ordering three or four pounds at a time from a mail-order roaster, dividing the order into half-pound batches, and freezing them all. Take out a pack as you need it, allow it to return to room temperature before opening, and do not refreeze. Do not store coffee in the refrigerators; they are moist, smelly places.</p>
